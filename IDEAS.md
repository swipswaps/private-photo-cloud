# Ideas

Some ideas that could make app better:

* Ask user if given even is somebody's party (e.g. birthday)
* Use mobile phone photos as current position for user
    - Use it to extrapolate other photos location
    - Ask whom is this phone, camera
* Search photos with smiles to rank higher
* Search photos with outstanding emotions (i.e. not common for the person) to rank higher
* Identify common places of person (home, work, typical routes)
* If location is uncommon -- it is probably a trip. Suggest a memory.
* Identify common cameras of persons (mobile, DSLR)
* If camera is uncommon -- it is probably a photo session or party
* Identify common persons on camera
* Identify who is shooting the media
    - Owner of device or another common person that is non on the shot
* If persons are uncommon -- it is some event
* Identify color spectrum of the image
* If image spectrum matches common mistakes -- suggest (or automatically apply) correction
    - E.g. for yellow-color images
* Split long videos into episodes
